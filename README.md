## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript & OOP

As a group, we had designated roles to tackle different parts within the project. The base-frame of the project was completed within our time constraint of 1.5 hours, and after was continously updated and refactored by other contributors.

## Optimizations

We had written and refactored our Javascript to follow best OOP practices.

## Lessons Learned:

We had gotten the chance to see and practice, as a group, object-oriented programming, as we had attempted to limit the complexity of the code with a main focus of readability.
